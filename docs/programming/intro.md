# Programming

Welcome to the 'Programming' section! This is the place where I write some of
my musings on programming-related topics. I can't guarantee everything will be
educational - but it might just be small things I find interesting, or perhaps
a short guide on how to do something. I am by no means a supreme expert at
coding, but hopefully some of these articles are fun to read.

My interests are usually C++, Networks, Operating Systems, a little bit of
Frontend development and Game development. I am also particularly interested
in low-latency systems, as I find it really fun to really push the limits of speed,
and some of the techniques used are very insightful. 

I also love algorithms and solving related problems on the various websites such
as codeforces and leetcode as a hobby. So you will definitely find some articles on techniques
and algorithms I find interesting :)

So these are some of the things you might expect to be reading here. There will be
other topics, so feel free to check the sidebar and see if there's anything that
piques your interest!
