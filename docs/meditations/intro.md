# Thoughts

Welcome to the 'Thoughts' tab! This is where I like to journal some of the
things I have been thinking that are NOT programming related. Honestly, the
topics can vary between many different things. I like to consider this a sort of
'open journal' where I can write whatever I think people will find interesting, and
to have some entries I can personally look back myself on as well.

It would make me happy if you check out one of the tabs on the sidebar on any topics that might pique
your interest :)
